</br>
A face is a unique identity of any person in a way that landmarks for everyone are different.
</br>
It allows the computer to identify if the face captured is identical or different. Using this theory, this project is about an application to identify facial similarity using an machine learning-enabled web API.
</br>
 </br>
Goal:</br>
● Understand more about the POST methods in the web API.</br>
● Apply the learnings from computer vision and facial landmarks for face similarity.

Match is only done with 87% accuracy, this ensures #security. The accuracy is not perfect, also because it is an initial project to teach my students. My students love it, and so do i! ❤️</br>
